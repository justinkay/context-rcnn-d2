# Context R-CNN

An (in progress) implementation of [Context R-CNN: Long Term Temporal Context for Per-Camera Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03538) on top of Detectron2.

Currently supports the long-term network only, and one contextual proposal per image.

More documentation coming soon.
